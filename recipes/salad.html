    <h1>Marinated Garden Tomatoes</h1>

<p>My grandmother first served this wonderful dish with tomatoes fresh from her garden when I was a child. 
    It's great on a hot day for a crisp side dish. 
    Often times I use the leftover marinade when the first batch is gone and add it to the next batch. 
    It's tangy taste is much loved, even by my non veggie-loving kids!</p>
